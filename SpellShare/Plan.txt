the code and logic looks good so far, let me give you the whole plan

multiple users will enter the frontend and enter their content on the textarea seperately, independently.


the backend will receive content from one client and update it to other clients


implanning to deploy this small app on github pages, lets focus on that later


for now let's just do the frontend and backend
